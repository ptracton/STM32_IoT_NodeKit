Move syscalls.c into the Src directory
Make sure to build for STM32L475VG
Put:
#define INTERNAL_I2C2_SCL_Pin GPIO_PIN_10
#define INTERNAL_I2C2_SDA_Pin GPIO_PIN_11
in B_L475E_IOT01A_BUS.H
Enable Timer6 interrupt

Thanks to you all,

 

I could print float value by adding '-u _printf_float' as you said.

 

following captureis project property , add it like this at Settings -> C- Linker -> Command: arm-atolic-eabi-gcc -u _printf_float
